        <h1>Overview</h1>

<p> <center>Many of the discussions of the future at CERN and the LHC era end with the
    question - Yes, but how will we ever keep track of such a large project?
    This proposal provides an answer to such questions. Firstly, it discusses the
    problem of information access at CERN. Then, it introduces the idea of linked
    information systems, and compares them with less flexible ways of finding
    information.
    <br>
     <br> It then summarises my short experience with non-linear text systems known
    as hypertext, describes what CERN needs from such a system, and what
    industry may provide. Finally, it suggests steps we should take to involve
    ourselves with hypertext now, so that individually and collectively we may
    understand what we are creating.</p></center>
    
    <br><h2><center>Losing Information at CERN</h2></center>
    
    <p>CERN is a wonderful organisation. It involves several thousand people, many
    of them very creative, all working toward common goals. Although they are
    nominally organised into a hierarchical management structure,this does not
    constrain the way people will communicate, and share information, equipment
    and software across groups.</p>
    
    <p>The actual observed working structure of the organisation is a multiply
    connected "web" whose interconnections evolve with time. In this environment,
    a new person arriving, or someone taking on a new task, is normally given a
    few hints as to who would be useful people to talk to. Information about what
    facilities exist and how to find out about them travels in the corridor gossip
    and occasional newsletters, and the details about what is required to be done
    spread in a similar way. All things considered, the result is remarkably
    successful, despite occasional misunderstandings and duplicated effort.</p>
    
    <p>A problem, however, is the high turnover of people. When two years is a
    typical length of stay, information is constantly being lost. The introduction
    of the new people demands a fair amount of their time and that of others
    before they have any idea of what goes on. The technical details of past
    projects are sometimes lost forever, or only recovered after a detective
    investigation in an emergency. Often, the information has been recorded, it
    just cannot be found.</p>
    
    <p>If a CERN experiment were a static once-only development, all the
    information could be written in a big book. As it is, CERN is constantly
    changing as new ideas are produced, as new technology becomes available, and
    in order to get around unforeseen technical problems. When a change is
    necessary, it normally affects only a small part of the organisation. A local
    reason arises for changing a part of the experiment or detector. At this
    point, one has to dig around to find out what other parts and people will be
    affected. Keeping a book up to date becomes impractical, and the structure of
    the book needs to be constantly revised.</p>
    
    <br><p>The sort of information we are discussing answers, for example, questions
    like:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Where is this module used?</li>
      <li>Who wrote this code? Where does he work?</li>
      <li>What documents exist about that concept?</li>
      <li>Which laboratories are included in that project?</li>
      <li>Which systems depend on this device?</li>
      <li>What documents refer to this one?</li>
    </ul>
    
    <br><p>The problems of information loss may be particularly acute at CERN, but in
    this case (as in certain others), CERN is a model in miniature of the rest of
    world in a few years time. CERN meets now some problems which the rest of the
    world will have to face soon. In 10 years, there may be many commercial
    solutions to the problems above, while today we need something to allow us to
    continue.</p>
    
    <br> 

    <h2><center>Linked information systems</h2></center>
    
    <p>In providing a system for manipulating this sort of information, the hope
    would be to allow a pool of information to develop which could grow and evolve
    with the organisation and the projects it describes. For this to be possible,
    the method of storage must not place its own restraints on the information.
    This is why a "web" of notes with links (like references) between them is far
    more useful than a fixed hierarchical system. When describing a complex
    system, many people resort to diagrams with circles and arrows. Circles and
    arrows leave one free to describe the interrelationships between things in a
    way that tables, for example, do not. The system we need is like a diagram of
    circles and arrows, where circles and arrows can stand for anything.</p>
    
    <p>We can call the circles nodes, and the arrows links. Suppose each node is
    like a small note, summary article, or comment. I'm not over concerned here
    with whether it has text or graphics or both. Ideally, it represents or
    describes one particular person or object. Examples of nodes can be:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>People</li>
      <li>Software modules</li>
      <li>Groups of people</li>
      <li>Projects</li>
      <li>Concepts</li>
      <li>Documents</li>
      <li>Types of hardware</li>
      <li>Specific hardware objects</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>The arrows which links circle A to circle B can mean, for example, that
    A...</p>
    <ul>
      <li>depends on B</li>
      <li>is part of B</li>
      <li>made B</li>
      <li>refers to B</li>
      <li>uses B</li>
      <li>is an example of B</li>
    </ul>

    <br>
    
    <p>These circles and arrows, nodes and links, have different significance in
    various sorts of conventional diagrams:</p>

    <p>The system must allow any sort of information to be entered. Another person
    must be able to find the information, sometimes without knowing what he is
    looking for.</p>
    
    <p>In practice, it is useful for the system to be aware of the generic types
    of the links between items (dependences, for example), and the types of nodes
    (people, things, documents..) without imposing any limitations.</p>
