<center><p><center>We should work toward a universal linked information system, in which
generality and portability are more important than fancy graphics techniques
and complex extra facilities.</p></center>

<p><center>The aim would be to allow a place to be found for any information or
reference which one felt was important, and a way of finding it afterwards.
The result should be sufficiently attractive to use that it the information
contained would grow past a critical threshold, so that the usefulness the
scheme would in turn encourage its increased use.</p></center>

<p><center>The passing of this threshold accelerated by allowing large existing
databases to be linked together and with new ones.</p></center>

<h2><center>A Practical Project</h2></center>
<br>
<p>Here I suggest the practical steps to go to in order to find a real
solution at CERN. After a preliminary discussion of the requirements listed
above, a survey of what is available from industry is obviously required. At
this stage, we will be looking for a systems which are future-proof:</p>

<ul>
  <li>portable, or supported on many platforms,</li>
  <li>Extendible to new data formats.</li>
</ul>

<p>We may find that with a little adaptation, pars of the system we need can
be combined from various sources: for example, a browser from one source with
a database from another.</p>

<p>I imagine that two people for 6 to 12 months would be sufficient for this
phase of the project.</p>

<p>A second phase would almost certainly involve some programming in order to
set up a real system at CERN on many machines. An important part of this,
discussed below, is the integration of a hypertext system with existing data,
so as to provide a universal system, and to achieve critical usefulness at an
early stage.</p>

<p>(... and yes, this would provide an excellent project with which to try our
new object oriented programming techniques!) TBL March 1989, May 1990</p>
