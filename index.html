    <p><center>This proposal concerns the management of general information about accelerators 
        and experiments at CERN. It discusses the problems of loss of information about 
        complex evolving systems and derives a solution based on a distributed hypertext 
        system.</p></center>

        <i>A hand conversion to HTML of the original MacWord (or Word for Mac?)
        document written in March 1989 and later redistributed unchanged apart from
        the date added in May 1990. Provided for historical interest only. The
        diagrams are a bit dotty, but available in versioins linked below. The text
        has not been changed, even to correct errors such as misnumbered figures or
        unfinished references.</i></p>
        
        <p>This document was an attempt to persuade CERN management that a global
        hypertext system was in CERN's interests. Note that the only name I had for it
        at this time was "Mesh" -- I decided on "World Wide Web" when writing the code
        in 1990.</p>
